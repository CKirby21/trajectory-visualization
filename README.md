# trajectory-visualization

My Brother and I were wondering how far you would get launched if you were strapped to the arm of a windmill ðŸ™‚

So naturally I made a little python program that calculates trajectories based on speed, body height, arm height, and launch angle

The result is a graph that tells you the optimal launch angles to maximize height or distance!

The program should work for any body-arm system (like a quarterback throwing a pass)

Clone repository and run windmill.exe in the dist folder to try it out!
