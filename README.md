# trajectory-visualization

My Brother and I were wondering how far you would get launched if you were strapped to the arm of a windmill ðŸ™‚

So naturally I decided to make a python program that calculates trajectories based on launch angle, height, and speed

The result is a graph that tells you the optimal launch angles to maximize height or distance!

The program actually works for any body-arm system which is a nice plus

Clone repository and run windmill.exe in the dist folder to try it out!
